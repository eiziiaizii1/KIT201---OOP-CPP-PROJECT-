## How to run?
### Running from the .exe
Unzip 'KIT-201.zip' and execute the .exe file. If you don't have 'Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables', it is recommended to download the latest version from Microsoft's official website.

### Running from the VisualStudio 
Clone the repository from GitHub to obtain the necessary project files, including essential SFML files and configurations required for Visual Studio.  
***Note:*** To ensure compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, we used the 32-bit version of SFML. Thus, when running the game from Visual Studio, select 'x86' as the 'solution platform' in Visual Studio settings.
